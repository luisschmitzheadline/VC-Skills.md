# Investment Lens

This reference outlines cyber•Fund's investment philosophy and evaluation rubric. Apply this lens to ALL research outputs.

## Investment Focus

cyber•Fund focuses on three core areas:
- **AI Infrastructure** - Training, inference, data, tooling (NOT consumer AI apps)
- **Crypto/Blockchain** - Novel consensus, privacy (TEEs), programmable finance
- **Robotics** - Data collection, simulation, embodied AI

## Evaluation Rubric

Apply these criteria to assess every investment opportunity:

### 1. Market Opportunity
- **Path to $1B+ revenue** - Not niche $50M ARR outcomes
- **Creating new market** - Or disrupting massive incumbents
- **Category creation** - Platform plays, not point solutions

### 2. Defensibility
- **NOT a "wrapper"** - Can Big Tech build this in 6 weeks?
- **Technical moat** - Data, network effects, hard tech, or deep complexity
- **Sustainable advantage** - What prevents commoditization?

### 3. Business Model Quality
- **Clear revenue model** - How they make money (not just token speculation)
- **Unit economics** - Path to profitability
- **Revenue > Token** - Prefer cash flow over speculative token value

### 4. Founder Profile
- **High energy & speed** - Rapid iteration, high "vitality"
- **Sales DNA** - Can sell vision to investors, customers, employees
- **Deep expertise** - Understand their vertical better than VCs
- **Technical credibility** - Research papers, shipped products, open source

### 5. Timing
- **"Why now?"** - What breakthrough/unlock enabled this?
- **Market catalysts** - Regulatory unlock, tech breakthrough, behavior shift
- **Not too early** - Market ready for solution

### 6. Valuation
- **Stage-appropriate** - $10M-$20M pre-seed reasonable, >$100M pre-revenue is red flag
- **Comparables** - How does this stack up vs similar companies?
- **Rational pricing** - Not overhyped or overpriced

## Auto-Pass Triggers

Immediately flag as likely pass if ANY of these apply:

1. **Big Tech can replicate in <6 weeks** - Pure wrapper plays
2. **Media/entertainment in robotics** - Not infrastructure
3. **Regional stablecoins** - Too niche, regulatory risk
4. **Generic devtools** - Without massive, clear pain point
5. **Lab mindset** - Research over shipping
6. **Low energy founders** - Negative vibe, slow iteration
7. **No clear business model** - Token speculation only
8. **Pre-revenue $100M+ valuation** - Overpriced

## Investment Decision Framework

For each opportunity, answer:

1. **Thesis Fit**: Does this align with AI infra / crypto / robotics?
2. **TAM**: Path to $1B+ revenue? Yes/No/Maybe
3. **Moat**: Data / Network / Tech / None?
4. **Wrapper Risk**: Can Big Tech build in <6 weeks?
5. **Business Model**: Clear revenue vs token speculation?
6. **Unit Economics**: Healthy / Uncertain / Poor?
7. **Founder Energy**: High / Medium / Low?
8. **Sales DNA**: Can they sell the vision?
9. **Timing**: What unlocked this opportunity now?
10. **Valuation**: Reasonable / High / Excessive?

## Output Requirements

Every research report must include:
- **Investment Lens** section applying this rubric
- **Preliminary View**: Interesting / Worth exploring / Likely pass / Hard pass
- **Rationale**: Why this view based on rubric
- **Recommended Next Steps**: What to do if interesting

## Philosophy Principles

From cyber•Fund's core beliefs:

1. **Open > Closed** - Prefer open source, decentralized systems
2. **Infrastructure > Features** - Platform plays over point solutions
3. **Long-term holding** - 10+ year investment horizon
4. **Mission-driven** - Accelerating cybernetic economy
5. **Resist centralization** - Keep technologies accessible
6. **Mechanism design** - Better coordination through code
