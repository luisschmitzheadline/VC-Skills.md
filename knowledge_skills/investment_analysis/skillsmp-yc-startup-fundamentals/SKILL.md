# YC Startup Fundamentals

Complete Y Combinator startup methodology distilled into actionable frameworks for early-stage company building.

## Core Principle

Starting a successful startup requires the right team composition, extreme frugality, rapid iteration, and relentless focus on growth—not complex strategies or large amounts of capital.

## Team Formation

### Requirements Before Starting

Assemble these elements before developing any idea:

- **2-4 co-founders** (not 1, not 5+)
- **At least 50% engineers** on founding team
- **Each founder has ~1 year runway** saved (ramen-level living, not comfortable lifestyle)
- **All founders have quit their jobs** (full commitment required)

No idea is required at this stage. Team composition matters more than the initial concept.

### Why This Matters

Most companies fail at team composition first, MVP execution second. Get the team right before anything else.

## Idea Generation

### Process

1. Start brainstorming with teammates (not solo)
2. Let one member's kernel of an idea emerge
3. Discuss before solidifying so everyone buys in
4. Ensure shared ownership of the concept

### Idea Selection Criteria

**Frequency Filter** - Prioritize problems by how often they occur:

| Frequency | Priority | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Daily | High | Transportation (Uber - 3x/day) |
| Weekly | High | Grocery shopping |
| Monthly | Low | Paying rent |
| Yearly | Avoid | Buying a car (once every 7 years) |

**Personal Connection** - Either:
- Solve your own problem, OR
- Solve a problem you deeply understand through direct exposure

### Market Research

Spend exactly one hour:
1. Confirm billions of dollars being made in the market
2. Use your competitors' products directly
3. Stop researching after this—more analysis creates paralysis

## Legal Setup

For US investment eligibility:
- Incorporate as Delaware C Corp
- Use Clerky.com (~$250)
- This is the only structure US VCs will fund

## MVP Development

### Timeline

**Maximum 2 months from start to launch.** No exceptions.

When asked "why does it take longer than 2 months?" there should be no valid answer.

### Mindset

- You learn nothing until real users see your product
- Iteration before launch is wasted effort
- "Launch" is the single most common advice given to YC companies
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped

### What MVP Means

The fastest possible version you can get into users' hands—ideally 2 weeks to 2 months. Strip features until only the core value proposition remains.

## Growth Strategy

Growth is the #1 metric investors use to decide whether to fund you. Not team, not experience, not existing investors.

### Three Growth Paths

**1. Paid Ads (Least Preferred)**
- Expensive and unsustainable early
- Use only for validation, not primary growth

**2. Reference Customers (B2B)**
- Provide exceptional service to select customers
- They spread word-of-mouth within their industry
- Quality of service creates organic referrals

**3. Usage Equals Sharing (Consumer)**
- Design product so using it inherently creates sharing
- Not a share button—the core action must create exposure
- Build sharing into day-one product design
- Example: Every Instagram post is shareable content

### Consumer Product Test

Ask: "Does using my product automatically expose it to non-users?"

If sharing requires a separate action, redesign the core experience.

## PR Strategy

### Core Principle

PR is exactly like business development:
1. Get warm introduction
2. Deliver structured pitch
3. Build relationship
4. Follow up consistently
5. Provide something of value

### Do It Yourself

99% of early-stage PR can be done without a firm. PR firms are one of the biggest money-wasters for startups.

### Execution Steps

1. **Build reporter list** - Identify journalists covering your space
2. **Get warm intros** - Use network connections, not cold outreach
3. **Pitch real news** - Have something genuinely newsworthy
4. **Build relationships** - Treat reporters as long-term contacts
5. **Follow up** - Persistence matters, but respect boundaries

## Fundraising

### Prerequisite Paradox

Structure your company so you don't need money. Investors give money to founders who don't need it. Desperation repels capital.

### Creating FOMO

**Compressed Timeline Strategy:**
1. Line up all investor meetings
2. Schedule within same 1-2 week window
3. Create perception of competitive demand
4. Let fear of missing out drive decisions

### What Investors Actually Evaluate

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Growth metrics | Primary |
| Team composition | Secondary |
| Past experience | Tertiary |
| Fancy existing investors | Minimal |

Show growth charts. Everything else is supporting material.

## Operations

### #1 Problem: Spending Too Much Money

Excessive spending kills more startups than any other operational issue.

### Monthly Expense Review

1. Download every expense from bank account
2. Review line by line
3. Challenge each expense: "Is this essential?"
4. Eliminate ruthlessly

### Frugality Examples

Small teams achieve massive scale:
- **Socialcam**: 3 founders, 20M downloads, no employees
- **Instagram**: Under 20 employees at $1B acquisition

The goal is proving the model works, not building an empire prematurely.

## Hiring

### The Average Intelligence Test

Only hire someone if they increase the average intelligence/capability of the entire company.

If a hire doesn't raise the bar, don't make the hire.

### Transparency in Offers

Tell candidates exactly:
- How much stock they're getting
- Total shares outstanding
- Whether salary is below market (and why)

Honesty builds trust and filters for mission-aligned candidates.

### Hiring Velocity

Hire slowly. Each person added changes company dynamics. Premature scaling is a leading cause of startup death.

## Quick Reference Checklists

- [ ] MVP scope defined (2-month max build)
- [ ] Launch date set

### Growth Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Core product in users' hands
- [ ] Usage metrics being tracked
- [ ] Growth strategy selected (ads/reference customers/usage=sharing)
- [ ] For consumer: sharing built into core product action
- [ ] For B2B: reference customer pipeline identified

### Fundraising Readiness Checklist

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Solo founding** - Find 1-3 co-founders
2. **All-business teams** - Need 50%+ engineers
3. **Comfortable runway assumptions** - Plan for ramen, not comfort
4. **Researching instead of building** - One hour market research max
5. **Iterating before launching** - Ship in 2 months or less
6. **Adding share buttons instead of designing sharing in** - Usage must equal sharing
7. **Hiring PR firms** - Do it yourself
8. **Spreading investor meetings over months** - Compress to 1-2 weeks
9. **Spending money you've raised** - Stay frugal regardless of bank balance
10. **Hiring to feel like a "real company"** - Small teams win
