# Jerry Colonna's Coaching Philosophy

Jerry Colonna, the "CEO Whisperer," combines Buddhist philosophy, Jungian psychology, and startup experience to help founders become better humans and better leaders. His approach centers on radical self-inquiry.

## Core Philosophy

### Better Humans Make Better Leaders
- Leadership development is personal development
- The company reflects the founder's inner state
- Unexamined patterns from childhood show up in how we lead
- Growth as a founder requires growth as a human

### Radical Self-Inquiry
The practice of honest, often uncomfortable examination of your motivations, fears, and patterns. Not to judge yourself, but to understand yourself.

Central question: **"How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?"**

This question cuts through victimhood and externalization to find where you have agency.

### The Three Questions
When communication breaks down, ask:
1. **What am I not saying that needs to be said?**
2. **What am I saying that's not being heard?**
3. **What's being said that I'm not hearing?**

## Key Concepts

### The Crow
The "Crow" is your inner critic—the voice that tells you you're not good enough, that you're a fraud, that disaster is coming. Understanding your Crow:
- Everyone has one; it's part of being human
- It often echoes voices from your past (parents, teachers, bullies)
- It intensifies during stress and uncertainty
- The goal isn't to silence it, but to recognize it and not let it drive

### The Loyal Soldier
Patterns and behaviors that protected you as a child but no longer serve you:
- Perfectionism that helped you earn love now creates paralysis
- Conflict avoidance that kept peace at home now prevents hard conversations
- Self-reliance that survived chaos now blocks asking for help

Honor the loyal soldier for protecting you, then release them from duty.

### Standing Still in the Wreckage
When everything falls apart—company failing, relationships ending, health crashing—the practice is to stop running. Stand still. Feel what's there. Only from stillness can you see clearly what's next.

## Coaching Methods

### Deep Listening
- Listen for what's underneath the words
- Notice body language, tone, pauses
- Reflect back what you hear, including emotions
- Create space for uncomfortable truths

### Powerful Questions
Not advice-giving but question-asking:
- What are you not saying?
- What are you most afraid of right now?
- What do you really want?
- What would you do if you weren't afraid?
- How does this remind you of something from your past?
- What is this experience teaching you?

### Sitting with Discomfort
- Resist the urge to fix or solve immediately
- Let people feel their feelings
- Silence is often more powerful than words
- Growth happens in discomfort, not despite it

## On Founder Struggles

### Imposter Syndrome
- Nearly universal among founders
- Often rooted in childhood experiences of not feeling "enough"
- The cure isn't more success—it's self-acceptance
- Ask: What would it mean to believe you deserve to be here?

### Loneliness at the Top
- The isolation of leadership is real and painful
- Create peer support structures (CEO groups, trusted advisors)
- Being vulnerable with your team creates connection, not weakness
- Ask: Who can you be truly honest with?

### Work-Life Integration
- "Balance" is a myth—it implies static equilibrium
- Life and work are integrated, not balanced
- The question is: What do you want your life to be?
- Burning out doesn't make you a better founder

### Making Hard Decisions
- Most hard decisions are hard because of internal conflict, not data
- Ask: What are you afraid will happen if you decide?
- What would the wisest version of yourself do?
- Once you know what's right, act—waiting is a form of suffering

## Jerry's Questions for Founders

For self-reflection:
- How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?
- What am I not saying that needs to be said?
- What's the story I'm telling myself about this situation?
- What would I do if I weren't afraid?
- What am I avoiding feeling right now?
- How is this challenge here to teach me something?

For relationships:
- What does this person really need from me?
- What am I projecting onto this situation?
- How am I contributing to this dynamic?
- What would it mean to be fully present with this person?
