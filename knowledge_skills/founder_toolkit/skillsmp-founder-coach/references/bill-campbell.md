# Bill Campbell's Coaching Philosophy

Bill Campbell coached Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Sheryl Sandberg, and dozens of other Silicon Valley leaders. His approach centered on building trust, supporting people, and driving operational excellence.

## Core Principles

### Trust is the Foundation
- Trust means loyalty, discretion, and having each other's backs
- Build trust through consistency between words and actions
- Never blindside people—give them advance warning of difficult news
- Keep confidences absolutely

### Be Radically Candid
- Tell people the truth, even when it's hard
- Deliver feedback directly but with care
- "You can be kind and still tell the hard truth"
- Don't let problems fester—address them immediately

### People First, Then Strategy
- Take care of people and they'll take care of the business
- Help people become the best versions of themselves
- Success is about the team, not individuals
- "Your title makes you a manager. Your people make you a leader."

### Build Community
- Create "team first" environments
- Celebrate wins together, own failures together
- Regular team activities build bonds that survive hard times
- The best teams operate like families (with healthy dysfunction)

## Coaching Methods

### The 1:1 Framework
Structure every 1:1 around five questions:
1. **Performance against objectives**: How are you doing on your key metrics?
2. **Relationship with peers**: How are your collaborations going?
3. **Leadership and direction**: Are you providing clear vision?
4. **Innovation**: Where are you pushing boundaries?
5. **Well-being**: How are you doing personally?

### Free-Form Listening
- Listen to understand, not to respond
- Let people talk through their problems
- Ask questions that help them find their own answers
- "What would you do if you were me?"

### Making Decisions
- If a decision needs to be made, make it
- Don't defer hard decisions—they only get harder
- Use data when available, use judgment when not
- Once decided, commit fully and move forward

### Giving Hard Feedback
1. Start with what's working
2. Be specific about what needs to change
3. Explain the impact of the current behavior
4. Express confidence in their ability to improve
5. Follow up and support the change

## On Team Dynamics

### Hiring
- Hire for smarts and hearts
- Look for people who are coachable
- Prioritize team fit over individual brilliance
- "Smart creatives" need environments where they can thrive

### Firing
- Fast is better than slow—waiting doesn't help anyone
- Be generous with severance
- Protect their dignity
- Help them land somewhere good

### Managing Conflict
- Healthy conflict is essential—encourage debate
- The leader's job is to break ties, not avoid conflict
- When people disagree, get them in a room together
- Once a decision is made, everyone commits

## Bill's Questions for Founders

When facing challenges, ask:
- What's really going on here?
- What do your people need from you right now?
- What decision are you avoiding?
- Who on your team is struggling and needs support?
- Are you taking care of yourself?
