# Coaching Frameworks for Common Founder Situations

## Situation: Making a Hard Decision

### Diagnostic Questions
1. What decision are you avoiding? (Bill)
2. What are you afraid will happen if you decide? (Jerry)
3. What data do you have? What's missing? (Bill)
4. What would you advise a friend in this situation? (Jerry)
5. What does your gut say? (Bill)

### Framework: Decision Clarity
1. **Name the decision** clearly in one sentence
2. **Identify the fear** - What's making this hard?
3. **Separate facts from stories** - What's actually true vs. what you're telling yourself?
4. **Consider the cost of inaction** - What happens if you don't decide?
5. **Commit and move** - Once decided, stop second-guessing

### Key Insight
Most hard decisions are hard because of internal conflict (fear of being wrong, hurting someone, looking bad), not lack of information. Address the internal conflict first.

1. **Create safety** - Meet in a neutral space, possibly with a third party

3. **Identify the core conflict** - Is it vision, roles, values, or style?
4. **Revisit the original deal** - Has the company outgrown your original agreements?
