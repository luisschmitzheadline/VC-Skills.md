# Other World-Class Coaching Perspectives

## Marshall Goldsmith

World's #1 executive coach. Coached 150+ CEOs. Known for "What Got You Here Won't Get You There."

### Core Philosophy
- The behaviors that made you successful can become obstacles at the next level
- Leaders often need to stop doing things more than start doing things
- Feedback should come from stakeholders, not just self-assessment

### The 20 Habits That Hold Leaders Back
1. Winning too much - needing to win every argument
2. Adding too much value - always having to contribute
3. Passing judgment - rating others
4. Making destructive comments - sarcasm and cutting remarks
5. Starting with "No," "But," or "However"
6. Telling the world how smart we are
7. Speaking when angry
8. Negativity - "Let me tell you why that won't work"
9. Withholding information
10. Failing to give proper recognition
11. Claiming credit we don't deserve
12. Making excuses
13. Clinging to the past
14. Playing favorites
15. Refusing to express regret
16. Not listening
17. Failing to express gratitude
18. Punishing the messenger
19. Passing the buck
20. An excessive need to be "me"

### Feedforward (vs. Feedback)
Instead of analyzing past failures, focus on suggestions for the future:
- Ask: "What's one suggestion you have for me to be better at X?"
- Thank them; don't critique or defend
- Implement the suggestions you find valuable
- Follow up and report progress

### Key Questions
- What do I need to stop doing?
- Who do I need to thank more?
- What feedback am I not hearing?
- What's the one thing that's getting in my way?

## Ben Horowitz

Co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz. Former CEO. Author of "The Hard Thing About Hard Things."

### Core Philosophy
- There are no shortcuts to hard things
- The struggle is the job—don't run from it
- Most management advice is for peacetime; startups need wartime leadership

### Peacetime vs. Wartime CEO
**Peacetime** (when you're winning):
- Focus on expanding the market
- Encourage broad-based creativity
- Build culture through consensus

**Wartime** (when survival is at stake):
- Focus on execution and hitting targets
- Make hard calls fast
- Lead through decisive action, not consensus

### The Struggle
The struggle is when:
- You wonder why you started the company
- You don't believe anymore
- You want to quit

The only way out is through. Every successful founder has faced the struggle. The question is whether you keep going.

### On Hard Decisions
- "If there were an easy answer, someone would have found it already"
- "Take care of the people, the products, and the profits—in that order"
- "When making a decision, ask: What would the company need me to do if I weren't personally affected?"

### Key Questions
- Am I in peacetime or wartime right now?
- What's the hard thing I'm avoiding?
- What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?
- What would be best for the company, not for me?

## Fred Kofman

VP at Google. Philosopher and economist. Author of "Conscious Business."

### Core Philosophy
- Business should be an expression of human values
- "Unconditional responsibility" - you always have a choice in how you respond
- Success comes from alignment between actions and values

### The Victim vs. Player Mindset

**Victim (Unconscious)**:
- "Things happen to me"
- Blames circumstances, others, luck
- Feels helpless and frustrated
- "It's not my fault"

**Player (Conscious)**:
- "I participate in creating my situation"
- Takes response-ability
- Focuses on what they can influence
- "What can I do about this?"

### Authentic Communication
- **Honest expression**: Say what you think and feel without blame
- **Respectful listening**: Hear others without defensiveness
- **Constructive negotiation**: Find solutions that honor everyone's needs

### Key Questions
- Am I being a victim or a player right now?
- What am I pretending not to know?
- What values am I expressing through this decision?
- How would I act if I were the person I want to become?

## Michael Bungay Stanier

Author of "The Coaching Habit." Practical, simple coaching framework.

### The 7 Essential Questions

1. **The Kickstart Question**: "What's on your mind?"
   - Opens the conversation without assumptions

2. **The AWE Question**: "And what else?"
   - The best coaching question in the world
   - Creates space for deeper thinking
   - Prevents jumping to solutions

3. **The Focus Question**: "What's the real challenge here for you?"
   - Gets beneath the surface problem
   - The "for you" makes it personal

4. **The Foundation Question**: "What do you want?"
   - Clarifies the desired outcome
   - Often harder to answer than expected

5. **The Lazy Question**: "How can I help?"
   - Prevents you from assuming what's needed
   - Forces them to make a specific request

6. **The Strategic Question**: "If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?"
   - Every yes has a hidden no
   - Forces prioritization

7. **The Learning Question**: "What was most useful for you?"
   - Creates reflection and closure
   - Reinforces learning

### The TERA Model for Conversations
- **T**ribe: Do I belong here?
- **E**xpectation: Do I know what's going to happen?
- **R**ank: Am I important here?
- **A**utonomy: Do I have control?

Increase TERA to make people feel safe enough to think and share.

### Key Insight
"Stay curious a little longer. Rush to advice and action a little slower."

### The Fear Exercise

5. Keep going until you realize you'd survive any outcome

### Anger/Fear Journal

1. Write down what happened
2. Write down what you felt

5. What else could it mean?

### On Meetings
- Every meeting needs an owner
- Every agenda item needs a purpose (inform, discuss, decide)
- Decisions should be made by one person, not consensus
- End every meeting with "What did we decide? Who does what by when?"

### Key Questions
- What's draining your energy?
- What would you do if this decision were reversible?
- What system could solve this problem permanently?
- Who should actually own this decision?
